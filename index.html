<h1>Welcome to the World of Faunadia</h1>
<p><i>“Scrolls and Crowns”</i> is a fantasy series rich in symbolism, 
  inspired by the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan. Set in the world of Faunadia, 
  it mirrors deep spiritual themes and the historical journey of the Christian church.</p>
<p>A deep conflict divides two factions: reptiles and amphibians, 
  who worship the sungods, and mammals and birds, who follow the Creator of Faunadia.</p>
<p>The Creator appointed a grizzly bear as the rightful king and cats as guardians of sacred manuscripts and laws. 
  However, out of jealousy, the rebel reptiles crowned a crocodile king instead, who founded the eastern 
  kingdom and sought to centralize power. In contrast, the grizzly bears built a decentralized royal 
  presence across villages.</p>
<p>The first book, <i>“Scrolls and Crowns: The Colorful Revolution”</i>, begins with the silent invasion of 
  the peaceful Muak Bach, by a rebel clan of red rats. They introduce a mysterious, addictive candy 
  called Rainbow Frolics, which distorts minds and identities, making them vulnerable to a coming rebellion.</p>
<p>The main characters, Maple—a strong grizzly bear carpenter—and Siam—a wise and scholarly scribe cat—share 
  a prophetic bond. Each was placed on Muak Bach with a purpose: Maple serves as the village’s physical 
  protector, while Siam safeguards it with wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>Their journey begins when they discover that Stardust Mint—the only known cure for the brain disorder 
  caused by Rainbow Frolics—has been stolen during the chaos of the Red War long ago; the rare mint is 
  now hidden deep within enemy territory. To save their folk, Maple and Siam must venture into the heart 
  of danger to recover it.</p>
<p>The series has a deep spiritual meaning. The grizzly bears represent the holy seed of Christ, 
  a lineage stretching from Adam to Mary, and culminating in the birth of Maple (Prince Mekhiel), 
  the son of King Elyon. During a time of intense persecution by the evil crocodile king, the bears lived in hiding. 
  To protect the royal bloodline, King Elyon entrusted his only son to a humble family of beavers, 
  who raised him in secrecy in Muak Bach. Instead of calling him Mekhiel, his beaver stepfather named him Maple 
  and taught him to live as a simple and humble carpenter, echoing the life of Jesus.</p>
<p>The cats, like Siam, symbolize the Holy Spirit, guardians of sacred scrolls and manuscripts. 
  They assist the bears in preserving truth and guiding Faunadia back to its true king.</p>
<p>The village of Muak Bach — the setting of the first book — is the last of seven villages, representing 
  the seven churches of Revelation. It was founded by a shepherd dog named Hessen, a character inspired 
  by Martin Luther, who left the central kingdom to restore the lost culture of village life and faith, 
  in a beautiful region called Celestium Valley. There he also found the valuable Celestium metal, 
  to forge the legendary sword Ebonfang, a symbol of the Sola Scriptura.</p>
<p>“Scrolls and Crowns” is not just an adventure book — it is a spiritual symbol in a grand allegory. 
  The series explores the story of the Christianity, the conflict between good and evil, and the spiritual 
  historical events of the world, wrapped in a powerful and imaginative narrative full of meaning.</p>
